        <p class="bio">This is a backcountry showdown of three of my favorite skiers. Each run will be scored based on style, technical difficulty, and overall impression. The course is powdery run with booters, rails, pillows, and features to jib to your hearts content...</p>

        <p class="bio">
There’s only one Tanner Hall. He has the accolades, the style and the respect of just about anyone who puts on a pair of skis. He’s a free spirit who is all about having fun in the sport he loves, sharing that vibe with everyone he meets and keeping it stylish the whole way through.  - Oakley</p>

        <h1 class="sectionTitle">Candide Thovex</h1>
        <p class="bio">In the short history of freeskiing (almost 20 years), there have been both masters of style and competition animals. The masters of aesthetics and the medallists. Nature rarely manages to mix the DNA needed to combine these two special disciplines, with the exception being Candide Thovex. - Quicksilver</p>

        <h1 class="sectionTitle">Eric Pollard</h1>
        <p class="bio">Born in the shadow of Mt. Hood, Eric gives much credit of his unique style to chasing around older friends who ditched racing gates to turn the entire mountain into a park. After several stand out film segments Eric started Nimbus Independent with friends Chris Benchetler, Andy Mahre and Pep Fujas. - evo</p>
